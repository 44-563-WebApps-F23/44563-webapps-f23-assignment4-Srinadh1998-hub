            HEDDA GABLER - Henrik Ibsen
        </h3>
        <p>
            A spacious, handsome, and tastefully furnished drawing room,
  decorated in dark colours.  In the back, a wide doorway with
  curtains drawn back, leading into a smaller room decorated
  in the same style as the drawing-room.  In the right-hand
  wall of the front room, a folding door leading out to the
  hall.  In the opposite wall, on the left, a glass door, also
  with curtains drawn back.  Through the panes can be seen
  part of a verandah outside, and trees covered with autumn
  foliage.  An oval table, with a cover on it, and surrounded
  by chairs, stands well forward.  In front, by the wall on
  the right, a wide stove of dark porcelain, a high-backed
  arm-chair, a cushioned foot-rest, and two footstools.  A
  settee, with a small round table in front of it, fills the
  upper right-hand corner.  In front, on the left, a little
  way from the wall, a sofa.  Further back than the glass
  door, a piano.  On either side of the doorway at the back
  a whatnot with terra-cotta and majolica ornaments.--
  Against the back wall of the inner room a sofa, with a
  table, and one or two chairs.  Over the sofa hangs the
  portrait of a handsome elderly man in a General's uniform.
  Over the table a hanging lamp, with an opal glass shade.--A
  number of bouquets are arranged about the drawing-room, in
  vases and glasses.  Others lie upon the tables.  The floors
  in both rooms are covered with thick carpets.--Morning light.
  The sun shines in through the glass door.

  MISS JULIANA TESMAN, with her bonnet on a carrying a parasol,
  comes in from the hall, followed by BERTA, who carries a
  bouquet wrapped in paper.  MISS TESMAN is a comely and pleasant-
  looking lady of about sixty-five.  She is nicely but simply
  dressed in a grey walking-costume.  BERTA is a middle-aged
  woman of plain and rather countrified appearance.

            TESMAN-

Fancy, Auntie--I had the whole of that portmanteau chock full of copies
of the documents. You wouldn't believe how much I have picked up from
all the archives I have been examining--curious old details that no one
has had any idea of--</p>

<p> TESMAN-

Yes, you don't seem to have wasted your time on your wedding trip,
George.
</p>
<p>
TESMAN-

No, that I haven't. But do take off your bonnet, Auntie. Look here! Let
me untie the strings--eh?
</p>
<p>
MISS TESMAN-

[While he does so.] Well well--this is just as if you were still at home
with us.
</p>
<p>
TESMAN-

[With the bonnet in his hand, looks at it from all sides.] Why, what a
gorgeous bonnet you've been investing in!
</p>
<p>
MISS TESMAN-

I bought it on Hedda's account.
</p>
<p>
TESMAN-

On Hedda's account? Eh?
