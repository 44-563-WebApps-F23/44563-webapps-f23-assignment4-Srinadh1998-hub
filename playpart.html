<h6> MISS TESMAN.</h6>
<p>[Stops close to the door, listens, and says softly:]</p> 
<p>Upon my word, I don't believe they are stirring yet!</p>

<h6>BERTA.</h6>
<p>[On the point of weeping.]</p> 
<p>And do you think it wasn't hard for me, too, Miss? After all the blessed years I've been with you and Miss Rina.</p>

<h6>TESMAN.</h6>
<p>[In the doorway between the rooms.]</p> 
<p>Aunt Julia! Dear Aunt Julia!</p> 
<p>[Goes up to her and shakes hands warmly.]</p> 
<p>Come all this way--so early! Eh?</p>

<h6>BERTA.</h6>
<p>[To TESMAN.]</p> 
<p>Shall I go in and see if there's anything I can do for the mistress?</p>

<h6>BERTA.</h6>
<p>[Going towards the right.]</p> 
<p>Very well.</p>

<h6>MISS TESMAN.</h6>
<p>[While he does so.]</p> 
<p>well--this is just as if you were still at home with us.</p>

<h6>TESMAN.</h6>
<p>[With the bonnet in his hand, looks at it from all sides.]</p>
<p>Why, what a gorgeous bonnet you've been investing in!</p>
